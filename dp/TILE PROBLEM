Ways To Tile A Floor
Given a floor of dimensions 2 x W and tiles of dimensions 2 x 1, 
the task is to find the number of ways the floor can be tiled. 
A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e as a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e as 2 x 1 tile

Input:
W = 3
Output:
3
Explanation:
We need 3 tiles to tile the board
of size  2 x 3. 
We can tile in following ways:
1) Place all 3 tiles vertically. 
2) Place first tile vertically.
and remaining 2 tiles horizontally.
3) Place first 2 tiles horizontally
and remaining tiles vertically.

long long numberOfWays(long long n) {
        //code here
      long long int   dp[n+1]={0};
        dp[0]=0;
        dp[1]=1;
        dp[2]=2;
        for(long long int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            dp[i]=(dp[i-1]+dp[i-2])%1000000007;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
