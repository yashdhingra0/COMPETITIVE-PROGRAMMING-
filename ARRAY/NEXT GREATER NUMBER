EXAMPLES : 
Input:  n = "218765"
Output: "251678"

Input:  n = "1234"
Output: "1243"

Input: n = "4321"
Output: "Not Possible"

Input: n = "534976"
Output: "536479"


ALGORITHM FOR FINDING NEXT GREATER ELEMENT 
Following are few observations about the next greater number.
1) If all digits sorted in descending order, then output is always “Not Possible”.
For example, 4321. 2) If all digits are sorted in ascending order, then we need to swap last two digits.
For example, 1234.
3) For other cases, we need to process the number from rightmost side (why? because we need to find the smallest of all greater numbers)

i) the first place where the left-digit is less-than the right-digit in last example 534976, its 4.
ii)  find the smallest digit larger than 4 to the right , its 6.
iii) place it to the left of 4
iv) sort the digits to the right of 6.



CODE:
void swap(char *a, char *b){
    char temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
 
void findNextNumber(char num[], int n)
{
    int i, j;
    for (i = n-1; i > 0; i--)// Start from the right most digit and find the first digit that is  smaller than the digit next to it. 
        if (num[i] > num[i-1])
           break;
    if (i==0)//If no such digit is found, then all digits are in descending order means there cannot be a greater number with same set of digits 
    {
        cout << "Next number is not possible";
        return;
    }
    int x = num[i-1], smallest = i; //Find the smallest digit on right side of (i-1)'th digit that is greater than number[i-1] 
    for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) if (num[j] > x && num[j] < num[smallest])
            smallest = j;
 
    swap(&num[smallest], &num[i-1]);//Swap the above found smallest digit with number[i-1] 
    sort(num + i, num + n);//Sort the digits after (i-1) in ascending order
 
    cout << "Next number with same set of digits is " << num;
 
    return;
}
