Given an array of size n where all elements are distinct and in range from 0 to n-1,
change contents of arr[] so that arr[i] = j is changed to arr[j] = i.

EXAMPLE
Input: arr[]  = {1, 3, 0, 2};
Output: arr[] = {2, 0, 3, 1};
Explanation for the above output.
Since arr[0] is 1, arr[1] is changed to 0
Since arr[1] is 3, arr[3] is changed to 1
Since arr[2] is 0, arr[0] is changed to 2
Since arr[3] is 2, arr[2] is changed to 3

A Simple Solution is to create a temporary array and one by one copy ‘i’ to ‘temp[arr[i]]’ where i varies from 0 to n-1. 
// A simple method to rearrange 
// 'arr[0..n-1]' so that 'arr[j]' 
// becomes 'i' if 'arr[i]' is 'j' 
void rearrange(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
  
        // retrieving old value and 
        // storing with the new one 
        arr[arr[i] % n] += i * n;  ////////////////important step mod kisi bhi number ka isme vhi dga 
    } 
  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
  
        // retrieving new value 
        arr[i] /= n; 
    } 
}
