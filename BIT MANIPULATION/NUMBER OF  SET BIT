////Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.






int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int c=0;
        for(int i=32;i>=0;i--){
            if(n&1){
                c++;}
            n>>=1;
            
        }
        return c;
        
    }
